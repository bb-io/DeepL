          <strong>Morning: Château de Chambord</strong> Begin your day with a visit to the legendary Château de
          Chambord, a masterpiece of French Renaissance architecture. This sprawling castle, with its 400 rooms, iconic
          double-helix staircase, and forested grounds, was designed for King Francis I as a hunting lodge. Wander the
          grand halls and rooftop terraces, where you’ll find sweeping views of the Loire landscape. Arrive early to
          enjoy the castle’s peaceful grandeur before the crowds arrive.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Midday: Lunch in Blois</strong> Just a short drive away, the town of Blois offers a taste of
          quintessential Loire Valley charm. Explore its medieval center, winding alleyways, and the regal Château de
          Blois, known for its eclectic mix of architectural styles. For lunch, stop by a local bistro where you can
          savor Loire specialties like goat cheese tartine or rillettes. Pair it with a glass of crisp Sancerre wine,
          cultivated just a few miles away.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Afternoon: Amboise and the Legacy of Leonardo da Vinci</strong> Head to the Château d’Amboise, perched
          dramatically over the Loire River, once home to kings and visionaries alike. Stroll through royal apartments,
          visit the Gothic chapel where Leonardo da Vinci is buried, and soak in panoramic views of the river and town
          below. Just up the hill, the Clos Lucé mansion was Da Vinci’s residence for his final years. Inside, you’ll
          find intricate models of his inventions, bringing the genius of the Renaissance to life.
