With a focus on communicating with the client at a personal level, even as technology continues to be more advanced, we continue to uphold the same spirit of great customer service that the company began with as we continue to create understanding in every language around the world.</p><p><strong>Our History</strong></p><p>CEO Peter Argondizzo envisioned Argo Translation during his first job out of college. As a project manager in the foreign language department of a medical device company, he grew frustrated with the translation process—the costs and the lack of accountability among companies offering translation services. “We can do better than that,” he thought. This is a new sentence.</p><p>Peter partnered with co-founder Jackie Lucarelli, and together, they grew Argo Translation to more than two dozen full-time employees who coordinate more than 300 translators worldwide. Bringing their combined customer service, translation, and corporate skills together, Peter and Jackie built Argo Translation not just on the constantly advancing technology in the industry but also on the human touch with every project. Personally being involved in every project provides a better relationship with both translators and customers, resulting in the best possible project outcome. Argo Translation continues to work with many of its original customers and is proud to continue to practice these work ethics every single day.</p></div></div></body></html>
